# Stowatch : HTML, CSS & JAVASCRIPT


This project focuses on building a stopwatch application with Start, Stop, and Reset features using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The stopwatch tracks time in seconds and milliseconds, with buttons to control its operation.

 HTML :   Created the structure for the stopwatch, including display elements to show time and buttons for Start, Stop, and Reset functionalities.


 CSS :   Styled the stopwatch display and buttons for an intuitive user interface. Ensured clear visibility of time and interactive button styling.


 JavaScript :   Implemented logic for:

 Start : Begins counting time by using the setInterval function, updating the display every millisecond.

 Stop : Pauses the stopwatch, halting the setInterval function.

 Reset : Resets the time display to zero and stops any ongoing count.


This project highlights your skills in handling event listeners, time intervals, and dynamic updates to the DOM.
