# Analog Clock : 

This project involves the creation of an analog clock using core web technologies: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The clock displays real-time hours, minutes, and seconds, with a user-friendly interface styled using CSS.

HTML: Structurally designed the clock's layout with elements representing the hour, minute, and second hands.
CSS: Applied custom styles for positioning the clock hands and ensuring they rotate smoothly. Additional CSS was used for visual aesthetics like borders, background, and clock face.
JavaScript: Implemented the logic to move the hands in real-time using the setInterval function, updating the rotation angles based on the current time fetched from the system.
This project demonstrates a practical understanding of DOM manipulation, CSS transitions, and basic JavaScript event handling.
